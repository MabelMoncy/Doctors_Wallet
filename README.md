## How to Use This as Your Project

### Using Eclipse IDE (Recommended):

1. **Open Eclipse**.
2. Go to `File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace`.
3. Browse to the cloned folder (`Doctors_Wallet`) and finish the import.
   - `.project`, `.classpath`, and `.settings` guarantee a smooth import as a Java project.

### Using Other IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, VS Code):

- Open or import as a Java project.
- You may need to manually mark the `src/` folder as a Source Root.
- In IntelliJ: `File > Open`, choose the project folder, then right-click `src` > "Mark Directory as > Sources Root".

### Project Structure

- `src/`: Java source code and modules (place your business logic under `src/com/`).
- `.classpath`, `.project`, `.settings/`: Eclipse project configuration.
- `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`: Git version control settings.

## Basic Installations and Requirements (Universal OS Support)

**1. Java Development Kit (JDK):**
   - Install JDK 11 or newer (choose your platform: Windows, macOS, Linux).
     - [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
     - [Adoptium OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/)
   - Set your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable and ensure `java` is available in your terminal.

**2. IDE:**
   - [Eclipse IDE for Java Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/) (best for `.project` support, runs on all OS).
   - Alternatives: [IntelliJ IDEA Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), [Apache NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/), [VS Code with Java Extension Pack](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java).
   - All listed IDEs are cross-platform.

**3. Git:**
   - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your OS.
   - **Alternatively:** Use GitHub Desktop (see steps above) if you're not comfortable with command line.

**4. (Optional) Build Tools:**
   - Add Maven/Gradle if you want dependency and build automation, though the current setup is plain Java.

**5. No External Java Libraries Required (by default)**
   - The initial setup uses no third-party libraries.
   - Add libraries via your IDE/project tool as needed (see each IDE’s documentation).
